 POLITICS_POKAYAN_DESC:0 "Immediately after the Control crisis, the mental surge of the souls of several hundred non-residents was embodied in a single person - Repentance Besprufovich Nepozhivov - a three-time executed victim of punitive psychiatry of the GULAG NKVD.

He personally appeared the spirit of the Holy Gachim Martyr, the Tsar of God-fearing Russia-which-we-lost - Nicholas the Second. The tsar picked him up with his mighty fists (Nikolai worked so that his hands did not stretch!!) And flew away, condemning the sacred mission of Repentance - to force the people of the former Russia (Real Russia died back in 1917) to pay and repent for their sins and crimes against humanity! The emperor flew across the Arctic Ocean and gently laid Repentance on the ground, which even before the control crisis was closest to the principles of "pay and pay" -Zemli of western Siberia, where such centers of repentance as Yekaterinburg and Novy Urengoy are located. Pokayan collects non-residents of the whole country into a single organization, the purpose of which will be to pay for the sins of scoops. Payment, both in the material and spiritual sense, of course. Penance has a lot of work to do, but the main thing is that abroad will help him! "
 POLITICS_LIMONOV_DESC:0 "Eduard Veniaminovich Limonov is a writer, leader of the banned National Bolshevik Party of Russia. After the ban, the NBP was the leader of the right-left National Social Democratic Party "Other Russia." He acted as an oppositionist, but did not achieve significant success. After the crisis of control, I saw an opportunity in the implementation of my plans. He revived the NBP and began recruiting recruits to the party's combat units. The plan was pretty simple. It has already been thought out before, now its implementation has become ready. Since the era of fragmentation and chaos has come, we must take advantage of the situation as soon as possible and... Liberate North Kazakhstan! "When is it not now?" - thought Limonov, and by a strong-willed decision ordered his militants to cross the Russian-Kazakh border. Surprise did its job, and the leader of the National Bolsheviks on horseback commands a parade on the square of the former Nur-Sultan, which was returned to its original name - Tselinograd. Farth- more. Eduard Limonov announced the need to regain control of all Russian territories and establish a climate of order, discipline and obedience on them.

"When I died, there was no one to refute it." - said Yegor. Letov hid for a long time in Taiga, given from prying eyes. At this time, he seemed to fly outside all measurements. He was waiting for a case that would be serious enough to appear to people again. And this case has come. Igor was quickly found by his party mate NBP Limonov, who was just preparing an invasion of Northern Kazakhstan. Letov joined the National Bolsheviks, because he understood that now is the time to fulfill their plans and he can help. Egor arrived in his hometown and began to rule in it, helping the National Bolsheviks with supply and propaganda. Omsk under Letov became a refuge for various kinds of extraordinary personalities and became part of the rocker union together with Novosibirsk. But there were people who did not recognize the authority of the "resurrected" punk or its radical ideas. A war broke out over control of the alliance, in which Letov intends to win, because Russia will be saved only by the world, universal revolution of the National Bolsheviks, and not by some liberal pop intelligentsia.

After the Control crisis, Sergey Yervandovich realized that Russia was captured by the gnostic spirit of Western postmodern. Destroyed countries, fragmented borders... It was a sign! A sign that it is time for members of the "essence of time" to get out of the catacombs and act under the leadership of the great Red Mysterio. A war began against the invisible forces of influence for the possession of the Fatherland. Gathering forces, Kurginyan's detachments began to attack the Gnostics and Blevaks, who captured the capital of Russia, but confused the direction and ended up in Kyiv.

Держит власть своими цепкими лапами так, что ни один камрад не посмеет сделать что-либо важное, не посоветовшись с ДимЮричем. А если, всё-таки, посмеет, и это не понравится вождю вождей, то велик шанс того, что его "пидорнут" в места, на самом деле, не столь отдалённые. Именно благодаря стараниям Пучкова, появилась идеология анархо-сталинизма, распространившаяся сначала на территории "Дикого, дикого Северо-запада", а после, нашедшая сторонников по всему миру. История Дмитрия Пучкова очень богата на события и анекдоты. Её можно рассказывать крайне долго, задевая разнообразные темы, но без одного элемента и талисмана обойтись точно нельзя. Дементий, тащи свиней!"

The Doctor promotes the ideas of communism as much as possible, but the fight against the strongest consequences of the Global Cataclysm will take most of his time.

He was ranked either among the left communists for criticism on the left, or among the Trotskyists, or among the Khojists for using the word "revision" when mentioning anything that Kerb did not like. Later, he was simply called a shizom. If it were not for his joining the armed struggle against the Infirmary, then he would simply be put in a fool's eye.

Его основные задачи - привести вверенную ему область в порядок и обеспечить продовольствием городам Чумного Пакта. Со всеми задачами Унц справляется медленно, но верно.

As with the Chat people, there was a conflict in the Moderators' Council on what to do next.

 POLITICS_VOVAAN_DESC:0 "Vovaaan (the number of letters "a" may vary) is a pre-imperial Bonaparte, a lazy militarist and the brother of the Plague Doctor. In the distant years before the crisis of control, Vova tried to become a professional esports player. Because of his excessive passion for Dota, his academic performance slipped into fucking shit. Since Vovaan did not enter the university, he had to join the army. Vovaaan was thrown to the very edge of the world - Kamchatka. There he was overtaken by the crisis of control. Chaos began in the military units and no one understood what was happening. Communication with the center was interrupted, so there was nowhere to wait for help. Everyone realized that dark times had come. Then Vovaaan came to power, using the support of the soldiers' mass and doter generals. When he did this, the population was so disoriented that no one really cared.Now that more and more power is concentrated in the hands of Vovaan, he can proclaim his plan for "returning home" - the military seizure of the entire territory of Russia. Vovaan wants to get to his home as soon as possible, and the remnants of the old army and the experience of the skating rink in dotan will help him in this. Perhaps Vova will be able to overcome his laziness, solve all the problems of his state and conquer Russia. Returning to Lyubertsy, he will enter his apartment and sit down at the computer again. In the military Pillboxes, he will tell endless army stories and swear at teammates. Isn't it worth fighting for?"
