Andrei aka Plague Doctor, the author of the Plague Doctor channel, became interested in her. The further he went through the game, the more it disappointed him, but the last blow was the fake ending, which caused a noble burn below the back. And all would be fine if this did not cause a breakdown in reality, which in the future will be called the Crisis of the Controls. In a matter of hours, the old world order collapsed, almost all the governments of the world, unable to cope with the Crisis, clapped. Abnormal cataclysms, time shifts, as well as phenomena from Internet culture have become a reality in the real world. The whole world plunged into post-apocalyptic anarchy .\n\nKK ended as quickly as it began when Yevgeny Ponasenkov, having received practically divine abilities during the next anomaly, decided to stop all this chaos. But during the restructuring of reality, something went wrong and the Maestro mystically disappeared halfway through the establishment of his Utopia. In one year, the QC devastated the world, dropping it scientifically by the mid-30s of the twentieth century. The countdown of the new calendar began, and the year when Ponasenkov disappeared will be declared zero. "

Everything began with the fact that Andrei, an aka the Plague Doctor, having concentrated the asset in the Infirmary party, could revive RSFSR within the Central Russia and the Urals. In turn, in Transbaikalia and the Irkutsk region power was seized by Zeder's henchmen and created the scrappy Reich divided into thousands and thousands of provinces. Of Kamchatky edge Andrei's brother serving at that time in an armeyka - Vovaaaan took control. The plague Doctor decided to seize the moment for revival of the Soviet power on open spaces of the CIS and began full-scale approach in many directions to reunite with Vovaan and Zeder and to destroy the disloyal varlorod which filled a vacuum of the power on open spaces of a Post-Soviet heathland. \n\nodnako the Zedera mode was extremely unstable. As a result the GENIUS Kodzima began the Great Buryat national revolution against the fascist mode. All came to an end in regime collapse of Zeder and full defeat of his supporters. Albert was killed, but still it is rumored that he could escape. In other all this guesses. \to revenge n\nchtoby for the death of the companion, Doc began offensive operation code-named "... Bezvidna is also empty..." on purpose - to destroy the state of Kodzimy. But something went wrong - all tank park rolled in waters of Baikal, and солдатня with shanks from shovels could oppose nothing to fighting cybercutlets from Yandex. Food, Deleveri Club and to Kodzima who swore on fidelity of the 54th separate Buryat regiment of horse divers. Troops of Infirmary got stuck in a siege of Irkutsk. \n\nB the same time Nikolay of the Second landed on the Pokayansky earth of Pokayan Besprufovich Nepolzhivov - three times the shot victim of Stalin retaliatory psychiatry of GULAG of People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs. At that moment still nobody managed to begin to press Contra which gathered around Pokayan as all moderators were thrown on the front. In turn Doc's attempt to save Zedera helped pokayanets - there was an ideal opportunity again to equate Nazism and communism. \n\nKak the investigation of all Siberia began mass revolts of fighting hamsters, ladders-chernorubashechnikov (continue the list) and just juvenile morons. On December 2 the 1st year the siege from Irkutsk was raised and troops began to bring down on the Trans-Siberian Railway to the Urals, however a part of troops didn't manage to be evacuated. Someone joined red guerrillas, and someone under the leadership of Sauron could leave on the North of Siberia where already nobody could find them."

 lazaret.3.d:0"After the signing of the Chelyabinsk world, it became obvious that the revolution was postponed indefinitely, while life in the country should be organized here and now. Despite the concentration of the Infirmary party on suppressing the counter-revolution of the country's restoration from the consequences of the war and the Crisis, several centers of power were de facto created in the RSFSR. If Ch.A.T. was divided into moderators, then the former RSFSR - into cliques led by the moderators who distinguished themselves during the Great Campaign. They manage the territories under their control, quite quickly, so this system can be relatively effective from an administrative point of view (no), then in political terms, complete demarcation is possible, which ultimately can lead to the collapse of the state. Therefore, it is advisable to integrate cliques into their composition in the future, which some of the newly made kings will not want from the word at all .\n\nAt the moment, we have lost contact with the 10th Army of Bolshakov, the 6th Horse-Mechanized Corps of the Stavropol Agronomist and the 4th Combined Arms Army of Sauron the Great. One of the subsequent tasks is to unblock them and try to reassign them to themselves .\n\nHowever, these are all far off, since the state of the territories subordinate to the Socialist Republic of the Infirmary is very depressing: due to the defeat in the war, many moderators became disillusioned with the current system, the liberals were not undermined and the Chumako-Kerbov bloc is increasingly beginning to show itself. If we suffer another major political defeat, then an uprising against the current system will begin. From the economic point of view, the RSFSR has not yet recovered from the de-industrialization of the post-Soviet era, and it is still in the state that the old system has been destroyed and the new one has not yet been created .\n\nThe era of new great achievements is ahead, and perhaps it is you who have to accomplish what the Bolsheviks could not do in a brave world.

 chat.4.d:0"At the current congress of the council of moderators, the fate of the Chat is being decided. Supporters of the demilitarization of the political system have already taken their seats. Most of the seats on the council are occupied by them. They will vote for the election of the head of the Chat, so that the masses themselves choose their representative, and the path that the country will follow. This faction consists of moderators with relatively different political views who believe in the need to change the country's governance system. The other part of the council stands either in the position of neutrality, or in the position of preserving the current state of things. One of the radical groups of opponents of the elections proposes to further strengthen the powers of moderators, in particular their leader, a Witness from Symmunism. They believe that the rejection of the dictates of moderators under the leadership of their so-called Mastera is treason to the Infirmary. The positions of the Witness faction are strong in the army, so his voice can be weighty, even if his faction holds few seats in the council. It must be admitted that they also represent a very strange and incomprehensible ideology in the council. By the way, where are they? The Council of Moderators should start the congress any minute, and not a single opponent of the reforms was seen in the building. This is very suspicious. They wouldn't have given us the victory so easily. Does the Witness want to use his connections in the army to seize power in the Chat? We need to deal with this urgently, we will send loyal forces to detain the Witness. Or not? Maybe it's for the best that he's not on the council? It will be easier for the Reformist faction to change the chat system at the council congress."

As it turned out, the fears were not in vain. The witness was found in one of the military units near the Capital. There he and a group of accomplices prepared soldiers for a campaign against the Council of Moderators. The moderators, with the support of loyal forces, managed to disarm the military unit, arrest the Witness and the so-called “gachists”, supporters of the Witness. The members of the Moderators' Council have already expressed their gratitude to the people involved in the detention. However, it's too early to relax. How do we know how many “gachists" there really were? It is necessary to check every major general of the army and interrogate the “gachists" who have already been caught."

The Witness used soldiers of a military unit located near the capital as an armed force. Tired of instability, the soldiers followed their commander-in-chief. Ordinary residents did not understand what was happening, and the Council of Moderators was suspiciously silent. Nevertheless, a small column of gachists entered the city unhindered. They have gained a foothold in one of the local printing houses and are already sending an appeal to local law enforcement agencies."

What made you..."\n\n- "Everything is ready and on time. Our mutual acquaintances sent me to command a joint militia group of communities and landowners. They will be there soon, here is the message."\n\pAhora gave the envelope. After reading the letter inside, De Loxley realized that the time for rebellion had come. The red moderators are ready to go after the counter-revolutionary, but they will not succeed. Here, in the south, the anarcho-tsarists have the advantage - they are already ready to rebel. In addition, the General has already taken control of Penza, the patrimony of the libertarian Jucheists, for a month. Now they need to attack the Stasist in a tactical alliance.

Protests and rallies against the gachists immediately began. Rallies arise spontaneously, but are quickly dispersed by the local police, controlled by the Witness. In addition, there were attempts to break the isolation of the Council, which were successfully, albeit with great difficulty, suppressed. In the Council itself, even in such a situation, disputes continue about the fate of the chat. The leaders of the factions are ready to hold a joint defense of the building, but they have not yet agreed to any other cooperation. The situation has clearly escalated, which does not contribute to the plans of the gachists, but the initiative remains in their hands. What will this situation lead to? One can only guess..."

Everything is going to separate these regions from the Chat or even to the beginning of their campaign against the Soviet government. But not everything is so bad. We were preparing for the worst, and that's why we also gathered our supporters and put them on alert.

There are still a sufficient number of supporters of the regime on our territory and something needs to be done with them. In Kazan, a large number of workers support the leftist regime, and there are still disloyal military units throughout our territory. There is an opinion that it is necessary to start hunting for all disloyal. An alternative opinion is called Suitcase-Railway Station-Lyubertsy. Supporters of this opinion speak of the need for the immediate expulsion of all disloyal.

Investigation on the operational channel obtained information that this is not about peaceful demonstrations against" falsifications" and just riots any more. The counterrevolution arms, smashes warehouses and agitates local military units. Because of confusion in military hierarchy owing to gachistsky cleanings we can't just order to military units to resist. Military show apathy and no orders from above can force them to understand what occurs. Our further actions have to correct a situation somehow. We have to take measures. We need or to influence the fooled peasants, having issued the law on distribution of the southern lands in their advantage, or prepares for the worst and to direct resources to expansion of production of weapon."

De Loxli is the leader of a protest, he unites figures of influential bandits, bourgeoises, fists. We needed to strike him earlier, but then we had no such forces.

Akhora gave all local government to the satraps whom he reasonably placed in provinces of the Chat.

Supported by the rabble, Loxley was chosen the king of anarchy, which fundamentally contradicts the very concept of the monarch. It was a mockery, but Loxley did not notice it, since he himself believed in these destructive ideas. A pitiful sight. The sound grain of the struggle against the leftists was lost almost immediately, since the Loxist movement itself was leftist, even if it was called partly monarchical. But still, Loxley at least did something right - he actually put power in the hands of his loyal general, who will begin a new era for the residents of Chat.

The first way is a compromise with the capitalists and the kulaks, the passage of the second way will ensure the loyalty of the military, some part of the intelligentsia and workers.

A little more and he would have been able to take power. If it wasn't for the army.. And then his pseudonym would have seemed absolutely not funny to us. “This thought has long been in the head of not only Barkov, but also half of the officers sitting in the hall. Barkov no longer made toasts and spoke little - he pondered his thought. The NOD as a movement is built as a totalitarian one-party system. Everything is in motion and nothing is out. Only the army managed to get at least some autonomy due to the strength of the generals and the lack of development of the special services of the Coordinator. However, the country survived, not at the expense of Fedorov's associates, but at the expense of the army. If Fedorov joins the army, he will most likely inadvertently bring down his strongest support. Instead of an army, there will be a rabble of politicized gopnik, inside of which a new conspiracy will surely mature, and then another.

At the same time, such detachments caught potential "terrorists'' and seized the found weapons. Numerous paramilitary organizations were disarmed by the forces of the professional conscription army. The generals who organized the introduction of a special provision were headed by Colonel-General Barkov, who encouraged them all to do such an act. This act may be called an illegal military coup, but Barkov himself understood that he was doing a necessary and quite good thing, which should not be soiled with such dirty terms from third world countries and history textbooks.

He has taken over the entire foreign policy, economy, border troops and police.A young officer in the green uniform of a long-gone country quietly sneaked into Barkov. His eyes clearly showed surprise and some kind of insane fear. All the officers were scared - Fedorov obviously took them firmly by the ass and intimidated them, or maybe it was just such a reaction to his superiors, to whom he had recently been transferred. Barkov decided to start a conversation:\n\n-Have a seat, Comrade officer. Do you want kushats?\n-Well, yes...\n-Fly in, - Barkov pushed a plate with a spoon towards the guy - you obviously haven't tried my gravy yet. With sanctioned seasoning, by the way.\n-Foreign?

Just add gravy?\n\pBarkov sighed heavily. What should I have said to this youngster? How can he explain his views? Finally, he found the right words.\n\n-Listen, have you noticed that everything in our movement is fucking nonsense?\n-In what sense...?\n-There is movement, but there is no progress.\n-I don't understand you, Mr. Barkov...\n-Well, what's not to understand!? Fedorov is a pathetic hypocrite and a faggot!

And he still dares to talk about fucking Americans! Besides, he's just incompetent. It is his fault that we are not sitting in Moscow right now. \n\nThe young officer continued to read until he had finished the whole plate.

By the way, your gravy is shit!Hearing this, Barkov took a plate and smashed it on the officer's head.\n\nThe young guy fell to the floor with a quiet groan.

I think it will be difficult for you to realize this, but Putin could not wander around Russia and survive for so long. Everyone understood this deep down, but Fedorov used our belief in a miracle for his own selfish purposes. Now we all have to understand that Putin is not a super–strong being, he does not have mythical power and he is not our only hope. Using my powers, I award Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin the title of “Hero of Russia". Posthumously.

I received my general rank when I started serving under the banner of the NOD, but I did not change the colonel's shoulder straps. I swore that I would not wear the general's shoulder straps until I defended Russia. Swear, then, that you will fight to the end for the sake of saving the Motherland. But for now, I insist that you pay tribute to the hero of Russia while there is such an opportunity. \n\n Thousands of people put their hands to the sarcophagus that day.

This time he did not write another continuation of the series of methodological manuals on animal husbandry "How to help sick cattle", but a novel in the genre of alternative history.\n\nThe action of the novel "Self-quarantine" takes place in a world where the catastrophic events of the crisis of the end of 2019 did not happen. The main character of the novel is a student of MGIMO of Ukrainian origin, Potap Egorenko. He contemplates many world events taking place around him. The main plot develops around a new virus of animal origin - Korovavirus. The novel shows the ineffective measures of capitalist states to combat the virus, touches on the theme of the global crisis, the state of society during the quarantine period and the collapse of global economic ties. Society perceived the novel ambiguously. Some critics point out that Pyotr Zvonov is still inexperienced in writing a novel and too often switches attention from the main character to global world events. People also reacted ambiguously to the deaths of a large number of famous people in the novel due to natural causes, when in reality they continue to live. Other critics note the presence of good humor and an original plot. Peter Zvonov reacted to the criticism of plot twists like this: "This could all have happened in a parallel universe, why are you choking like that, huh?".Nevertheless, the publication of the novel is one of the biggest literary events in all the years after the crisis of control."

But, seeing the destruction and the gradual disappearance of anomalous phenomena, the Permians decided to live on, yearning among the abandoned and Khrushchev to post-punk. And then came different varieties of communists, united by the mysterious Plague Doctor. However, a year later, the confrontation between Sverdlovsk and Lyuberets first touched the Perm region. One of the conditions for peace between the two forces, Lazaret and Repentance, was the creation of a buffer of neutral states in the Ural mountains. One of these states was Pelmenia. A compromising option was the establishment of the Ural dumplings regime in Perm. From Sverdlovsk and from Moscow, the participants of the show were gathered and staged by the heads of the country. Things are not going well at the moment. Lack of qualified personnel, constant influence from the east and west led to problems that the new government was struggling to solve. In the group of Ural dumplings itself, there is no confidence in their abilities. All this gives ground to populists who can germinate into the masses, gather their strength and displace incompetent power. Currently, even power structures are only being formed and a coup is easy enough if the opposition forces are concentrated. But the Ural dumplings still seem like an excellent solution, compared to the unknown Nikolai Rosov. At least they're still playing shows. "

And Rosov was waiting for two more people to come to the congress of his party to collect the minimum for the event. In the shadow of the concert was the First Congress of the Russian Renaissance Party, which was going to proclaim legitimate power in the region. Even the inhabitants of the hinterland did not come - they were also more interested in the concert, which they managed to watch with the help of a partially restored radio and film infrastructure. The convention never began. A week later, Nikolai Rosov will be found, littered with fan fiction about a pony of his own production, calling out something misanthropic in disguise .\n\n After the concert, the Ural dumplings decided who would now become the official head of state. Dmitry Sokolov ruled from the very beginning, could not cope with the operational solution of problems, but is it his fault? The candidate for his replacement is Dmitry Brekotkin, who organized a connection with the remnants of Tricolor TV to receive the show's broadcast to the most remote corners of the country.

Now in the semi-dark stone halls of the Comian parliament there was a fierce debate about who should take his place. At the moment, 3 main candidates stand out :\nLevoborod, he is just BOROD or Igor Alexandrov, a machine gunner, blogger and simply the leader of the lumpen-cassiriate, during the Great Campaign of the Infirmary to the East, he actively began to create a labor movement in Komi, and during raids resurrected personally by Repentant Besprufovich innocently convicted Nazis (who wanted peace and did not want to fight) organized a social chauvinistic detachment for the defense of Syktyvkar. During the detachment's retreat from the penitents, Beard was lucky enough to meet with Father Maxim, who his detachment was able to save from the advancing enemy troops - he helped us cross the river and break away from the Penitential troops. Subsequently, he held important government posts and eventually rose to the post of Minister of Trade of the Republic. He still believes that the labor movement should take power in the country and establish a Zhozheki dictatorship. The character is cheerful. Married .\\nSanta Claus, after moving from Veliky Ustyug, also became a very influential figure in Komi, since he still has powerful magic that can create a New Year's mood. He has wide foreign contacts with Santa Klaus, is suspected of illegally distributing prohibited products of Coca Cola and of smuggling drugs under the guise of children's New Year's gifts. However, he is a very influential and undoubtedly honest businessman whose assets seriously affect economic life in the state. The character is secretive. Widower. Has a granddaughter Snow Maiden .\\nGeneral Frost is considered an evil twin brother of Santa Claus. The hero of millennial Russia, created in time immemorial from a pure sustained pagan fear of the harsh Siberian Arctic winter of the Russian North. According to unverified data, he is the ancient god Karachun, who appeared in the flesh during the Crisis of Controls. Since the settlement of the Great Russian Plain by Slavic tribes, he guarded and defended it with a tough hand, both from the enemies of Russia and from the Russians themselves. He remembers the glorious victories of 1612, 1812, and 1941 near Moscow (for which he was and was shot in the basements of punitive psychiatry of the Gulag of the NKVD for anti-Soviet activities and sabotage). After his execution, he became an ardent anti-communist. He acts as an ardent patriot and defender of Slavic Russia. The character is bad.

The capitalists, protesting against the rise to power of the left, began widespread anti-ilk propaganda among the population in order to discredit Levoborod and intimidate with a new famine. People (largely the elderly population), subjected to right-wing propaganda, rushed en masse to buy TNP goods, especially sugar. Less than a few days later, the inventory of < < < white > > gold in warehouses has come to an end, and some people are already starting to smash stores. Against the background of sugar shortages, a group of former criminals and crooks rose, who speculate on sugar prices and make big profits.

Late in the evening, working with documents, Igor Alexandrov heard a strange voice calling him, turning over the entire office and not finding the source of the voice, Borod referred to fatigue and decided to go on vacation. However, what a surprise he was when walking next to the mirror, he discovered strange changes in the beard, the side of which began to resemble a peculiar mouth. After groping his beard, this mouth bit his hand, after which he began to explain that it was a separate person! The anomaly of the Crisis of the Control not so long ago acquired self-awareness and does not wish evil to its bearer - it wants to serve the cause of socialism.
