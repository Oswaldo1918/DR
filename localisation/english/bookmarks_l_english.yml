 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0"World field of experiments"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0"This is how three years have passed since the Control crisis. The old world as we remembered it - with overnight, chaos and disorder, here is the new credo of the world. On the territory of the former Russia, the Great War between Lazaret and Pokania ended not so long ago, in which the latter won. The army of Limonov invaded Northern Kazakhstan, and Kurginyan invaded Ukraine. In China, border conflicts between China and Shambal are increasingly flaring up. While in the Far East, Doter regiments are ready to walk throughout the former Russia. The world is bursting at the seams, but could it be even worse?."

 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0"Yes, that's right! A collection of umbrellas can come in handy today."
 POK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0"The main stronghold of democratic ideals and liberal values ​ ​ in Russia is Repentance. The name of the state refers to its main mission - to make all Sofks repent for their sofkishness. This is the idea of ​ ​ the freedom-loving elder Penance Besprufovich - the father of inferiority and the leader of Penance. However, various groups have their opinion on the future fate of the state and will defend it in the next election. The election struggle promises to be difficult for the allowed parties, but there is one nuance... The remnants of the banned left parties and underground circles are preparing to overthrow the government."
 KUR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0"The territory located from Vinnitsa to Poltava region is now controlled by the Ukrainian authorities and Bandera, who fled to other parts of the once existing Ukraine. They are now ruled by the Essence of Time organization and its leader, Sergei Yervandovich Kurginyan. Having gone on a heroic attack on Moscow, the Red Mysterio mushroom pickers took Kyiv. Obviously, this ingenious maneuver was part of a plan to restore the borders of the Fatherland split by the enemies. Kurginyan creates another alternative center for the unification of Russian lands with a center in true, Fourth Rome!"
 NOD_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0"The National Liberation Movement is one of the powerful organizations of the former Russian Federation. Before the crisis, the president, along with the NOD, fought for an independent and strong country. But after the disappearance of Putin's power, Russia lost the remnants of its sovereignty and was defenseless against internal and external threats. The head of the movement, Yevgeny Fedorov, did not give up. He began to conquer the sovereignty of Russia with the help of spirituality, faith in the exclusivity of the Russian people and dangerous adventures. But few people know that Fedorov's aggressive policy was aimed not so much at capturing Russia as at HIS return."
 CHT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0"The Autonomous Region of CHAT is the frontier of a split Soviet Russia with a kind of social device. For a long time, the Cheboksary-Arzamas-Togliatti zone was a battlefield with the NOD army, therefore it was led directly on the spot with the help of moderators - people appointed here by the center and endowed with broad powers. But relatively peaceful times have come. The formed power in this territory began to feel much more independent. The question of what to do next has become urgent, because at the moment there is a real danger of military confrontation between supporters of various groups of the heterogeneous people of the artificial created state, because they can go to great lengths to realize their plans in life. "
 LAZ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0"The state in the historical center of Russia, the RSFSR, is controlled by the Infirmary party. Founded by the Plague Doctor after months of power vacuum that followed the Cataclysm. The state is built on socialist principles and prepares plans for the restoration of Russia and the USSR, plans for building communism. Of course, the state itself does not in any way look like either the USSR or the Russian Federation and has a huge bunch of unresolved problems and tasks. But did it ever stop the Communists? Moreover, the Cataclysm gave impetus to a real red revenge and it is possible that other chances of building communism may not appear for a very long time. "
 MRD_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0"The gloomy army of the rebellious general Sauron settled in the north of Siberia after signing peace with Repentance. It is said that Sauron was just waiting to rebel and take another step towards gaining unlimited power. Taiga lands have become a field for the implementation of his crazy plans and he is ready to implement them. To conquer the world, Sauron the Great needs an army, resources and influence. A grim MORDOR state was founded to concentrate all this. Sauron the Great, despite the progressive madness (and perhaps thanks to him), will try in every way to achieve his goals, no matter what they cost. "
 DOT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0"The wind of anger blows from the East and it carries the smell of a burnt pukan. The conscript took the people's club and went out on the warpath! He goes home from the army and nothing will stop him from sitting down again and playing Dotan. Neither a horde of orcs nor bandits will be able to stop him. The junta is weak and is just beginning to develop plans to seize all of Russia, and the confrontation between groups within the committee has not yet ended. The situation is aggravated by an uncomfortable geographical location. However, it would be a mistake to consider this state too weak for its ambitions. "

 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Other countries, large and small, are not ready in inaction, holding their breath, to expect how the new world conflict will end. The past war has largely redrawn the atlas of the world, changing the balance of power, and now the big players are ready to repeat it. Everyone will have to make tough decisions and find a balance between their ideals and cold pragmatism to influence what the world will be like in the future. "

 STR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0"Stavropol collective farm - an association created for the supply of food to the Infirmary. A collective farm the size of the region was organized by a certain "Stavropol Agronomist." Everything would be fine, but no one in the Infirmary heard about any collective farm in the Stavropol Territory. The regions are issued by the Plague Doctor under the control of only moderators, and the Stavropol agronomist was not a moderator at all. How he got power and what is happening in this state is decidedly incomprehensible. Rumor has it that this is about a more legendary but forgotten moderator who tried to fight for power but fell into disgrace (at least according to one of his personalities "
 OMS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0"The legendary city of OMSK became even more legendary with the appearance of Yegor Letov. Together with a gang of national Bolsheviks, he prepared plans for an offensive on northern Kazakhstan and became responsible for supplying the army from Russia, namely from his hometown of Omsk. Letov showed his creative creativity in managing the region. With the participation of Letov, the Rocker Union was created, which spread its influence from Omsk to Novosibirsk. Omsk, thanks to Letov's reforms, became the refuge of passionaries who were ready to rebuild Russia again. However, not everyone agreed to live in the conditions of the National Polish regime. The opposition forces of the Civil Society rebelled against him and began to advance towards Omsk. "

 BTS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0"Because of the QC, the Korean government began to give power to the BTS group. The K-Pop revolution took place quickly and bloodlessly, but the transformation of the state into a sect caused the death of about 300 thousand people. For 2 years, the entire population was in makeup and listened to BTS. Until in the middle of 2 years, KK came Goiko Mitich. He seized power in BTS thanks to his hard drive. Orthodox organized an underground led by former leader Kim Nam-joon. At the end of 2 years, KK Mitich began to carry out reforms called K-Pop perestroika. Listening to BTS songs ceased to be mandatory, and men were allowed not to wear makeup. This caused great discontent among the female part of the population, as a result, the partisans seriously joined their ranks, which is why some ministers are already thinking about joining the true BTS.
